Vtubers are streamers (usually on YouTube, hence "tubers") that choose to present themselves with a 2D or 3D avatar, rather than with her or his own real life appearance.

The hardware can be as simple as just a webcamera. On these cases a software recognize their expressions and movements and translate them to an articulated model. There can be more complex motion capture rigs such as full rooms equiped with infrarred mocap technology and professional illumination and cameras.

One of my favorite vtubers, a Dragon coming from USDA (United States of Dragon America) part of the talent agency "Hololive". Quick with her words, badmouthed but pretty funny and understanding. Every Sunday 12:00 (JST) presents a different colleague to the public and review Memes and funny pictures from reddit.
